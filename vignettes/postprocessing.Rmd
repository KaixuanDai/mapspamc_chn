The function `create_all_tif()` produces tif files of all crop distribution maps that are produced after the downscaling algorithm is solved and the results are combined in one rds file using `combine_results(param)`. In theory, the function creates 320 maps: 2 (harvested area and physical area) x 40 (crops) x 4 (production systems) but in practice the number will be lower, depending on the actual number of crops and production systems observed in a country. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
create_all_tif(param)
