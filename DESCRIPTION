Description: The aim of the mapspamc R package is to facilitate the
    creation of country level crop distribution maps. mapspamc provides
    the necessary infrastructure to run the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) for
    country level studies. The model builds on the global version
    of SPAM (You et al., 2006; You et al., 2009 et al.; You et al., 2014
    and Yu et al., 2020), which used a cross-entropy optimization approach
    to 'pixelate' national and subnational crop statistics on a spatial grid
    at a resolution of 5 arcmin. mapspamc was specifically developed to support
    country level analysis and makes it possible to incorporate national
    sources of information and create maps at a higher resolution of 30
    arc seconds.
