\arguments{
\item{param}{Object of type \code{mapspamc_par} that bundles all \code{mapspamc} parameters,
including core model folders, alpha-3 country code, year, spatial
resolution, most detailed level at which subnational statistics are
available, administrative unit level at which the model is solved and type of
model.}

\item{cl_slackp}{percentage of total cropland that will be added when comparing
physical area statistics to cropland extent.}

\item{cl_slackn}{times the area of the largest grid cell will be added when comparing
physical area statistics to cropland extent.}

\item{ia_slackp}{percentage of total irrigated area that will be added when comparing
irrigated area statistics to irrigated area extent.}

\item{ia_slackn}{times the area of the largest grid cell will be added when comparing
physical area statistics to irrigated area extent.}
