The aim of the [`mapspamc` R package](https://github.com/michielvandijk/mapspamc) is to facilitate the creation of country level crop distribution maps. The model builds on the global version of the [Spatial Production Allocation model (SPAM)](www.mapspam.info) [@You2006; @You2009; @You2014a; @Yu2020], which uses an cross-entropy optimization approach to 'pixelate' national and subnational crop statistics on a spatial grid at a resolution of 5 arcmin (~ 10 x 10 km). `mapspamc` provides the necessary infrastructure to run the Spatial Production Allocation Model at the country level and makes it possible to incorporate national sources of information and potentially create maps at a higher resolution of 30 arcsec [@VanDijk2022b].
