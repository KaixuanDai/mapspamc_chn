The aim of the [mapspamc R package](https://iiasa.github.io/mapspamc) is to facilitate the creation of country level crop distribution maps. mapspamc provides the necessary infrastructure to run the Spatial Production Allocation Model for Country level studies (SPAMc). The model builds on the global version of SPAM [@You2006; @You2009; @You2014a; @Yu2020], which uses an cross-entropy optimization approach to 'pixelate' national and subnational crop statistics on a spatial grid at a 5 arcmin resolution. SPAMc was specifically developed to support country level analysis and makes it possible to incorporate national sources of information and potentially create maps at a higher resolution of 30 arcsec [@VanDijk2020].
